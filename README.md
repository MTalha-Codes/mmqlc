# MmQL - The Mathematical Query Language 

> [!NOTE]
> ***This codebase will soon be rewritten in rust and this repo will be archived after it is done.***

**MmQL** is a very lightweight computational query language used to compute operations involving real and complex numbers (the queries are interpreted by **MmQLC**) developed purely in **C++23**.

---

## What is MmQL ?
**MmQL** is an acronym that stands for **M**athe**m**atical **Q**uery **L**anguage. It is an interpreted language as well as a case-sensitive **where uppercase and  lowercase matters**. The interpreter (**MmQLC**) is a custom and yet a very simple interpreter. Techniques like Tokenization and Parsing are used by **MmQLC**.

**MmQL** is a lightweight, *cross-platform* query language tailored for mathematical computations. Designed for speed and simplicity, **MmQL** allows users to write precise mathematical queries.
> [!NOTE]
> - Please note that **MmQL** is not a symbolic language, and it does not use CAS (Computer Algebra Systems)
> - **MmQL** is a unique because it does not use an **Abstract Syntax Tree**.

# What is MmQLC ?  

**MmQLC** stands for **M**athe**m**atical **Q**uery **L**anguage **C**ompiler (although this is an interpreter 😁). It is a **case-sensitive** interpreted query language with a minimalistic syntax, focused on mathematical operations.  

### Key Features:  
- **Portable and Cross-Platform:** The language can run on various platforms by compiling its interpreter for your operating system.  
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Perfect for quick and resource-friendly computations.  
- **Case-Sensitive Syntax:** Commands are interpreted based on their casing.  
- Specializes in:  
  - **Real Numbers**  
  - **Complex Numbers**  

**MmQL** is particularly suited for users who need fast, precise calculations without the overhead of complex mathematical software.

## Why Choose MmQL?  

**MmQL** provides a lightweight and flexible environment for mathematical queries, perfect for students and professionals looking for:  
- A **simple and efficient query language** for real and complex number calculations.  
- A **cross-platform tool**, for any operating system (Windows, Linux and Mac) via compilation.  

With its clean syntax and custom interpreter, **MmQL** delivers a tailored solution for performing mathematical computations. Compile **MmQLC** on your preferred OS, and you're ready to handle your queries with speed and precision!

## Using the MmQL Language For Calculations

**MmQL**  is pretty simple to use , just download either the installer(**Windows**) from **Release** section or the source code **(If you want to build it for yourself.)(Other than Windows)**
- First of all write queries by using text editor.
- Now for generation of answer file then you should run **MmQLC.exe** with special command line **arguments** defined for **MmQLC** The method for generating answer file from a query file is explained [**Here.**](DetailedDocs/MMQLC_USE.md)
- To view or see the answers, open the **.ans** in any text editor.

>- **MmQLC v2.2+** also includes a sophisticated **REPL** mode if you want direct calculations.

 > [!NOTE]
 > - Consider adding **MmQLC.exe** to your environment variables for running it from the shell directly. Click  [**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z84UIZy_qgE) if you don't know how to do it.


>[!NOTE]
> There will be no installer in the future. Building from source is recommended.

## Supported Queries
Following types of queries are supported by **MmQL**.
- ### Queries For Calculations Involving Real Numbers. Click [**Here**](DetailedDocs/REAL_NUMBERS.md) to see.
- ### Queries For Calculations Involving Complex Numbers. Click [**Here**](DetailedDocs/COMPLEX_NUMBERS.md) to see.

---

## Comments in MmQL
The MmQL language only support single-line comments.

**Comment Declaration**: 
Comments looks like this
- `%% Comment`

---

## Possible Errors
> [!CAUTION]
Compound queries or stacking multiple queries on a single line may cause errors.
Nesting two or more queries or using inline comments will also throw errors.
### Examples of errors:
- Compound Queries: `ADD 3,4 FACTORIAL 43`. This is strictly prohibited.
- Direct Nested Queries: `FACTORIAL ADD 3,4` , `INVERSE_SINE SINE 45`. Can be tackled via variables.
- Inline Comments: `ADD 4,5 %% add two numbers`. Work In Progress.

## Message !:
Active development has been stopped from now till my 12th class exam ends.... Development will be continued somewhere after 20th July 2025, after I qualify the GIKI Entrance Test with Fully Funded Scholarship (Please Pray For Me 🤲 😢).
However, the codebase will be constantly reviewed and optimizations and refactorings will be done when needed.
