# About Variables 
Variables are introduced in **MmQLC v3.0** and will remain a standard feature of the project from now and onwards.

---
## Declaring Variables
Variables are declared using the `SET` query followed by variable name , equal sign and value that you want to assign.

**For Example:**
- `SET VAR_NAME = REAL_NUMBER`
- `SET VAR_NAME = COMPLEX_NUMBER`
- `SET VAR_NAME = QUERY ARG`
- `SET VAR_NAME = QUERY ARG_1,ARG_2`
- `SET VAR_NAME = QUERY VAR_NAME`
- `SET VAR_NAME = QUERY VAR_1,VAR_2`

are the supported modes of declaring variables.

---
## Re-Assigning Variables
Re-assigning variables is just same as how you declare variables.

---
## Getting/Fetching Variables
Variables are fetched using the `GET` query followed by variable name.

**For Example:**
- `GET VAR_NAME`
> [!WARNING]
> **It is compulsory that the variables must be declared before fetching.**

---
## Using the variables with queries
> [!NOTE]
> **The variables `a` and `b` are present somewhere in the memory of MmQLC**

### Queries that depends on two arguments
```mmql
QUERY a,b
```

### Queries that depends on one argument
```mmql
QUERY a
```
---
## Feature Underdevelopment 🐣
**Inshallah, the following features regarding to variables will be completed by the next update.**

**Using variables with numbers directly**. 
- `QUERY number,var`
- `QUERY var,number`

> [!NOTE]
> The type of **var** and **number** must be same. Intermixing real and complex types are not allowed.

**Assigning the value of one variable to another**:
- `SET NEW_VAR = OLD_VAR`
