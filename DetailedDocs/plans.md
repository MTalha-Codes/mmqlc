# Our Future Plans
The most essential update that needs to be pushed out is **Better And Robust Variables System**. Other updates will include basic language based features.

## After these updates, MmQLC will be able to 
1. Evaluate query that involves variables of two distinct types.
2. Evaluate multiple comma seperated queries on a single line in **REPL**.
3. Evaluate multi-line comments both in **REPL** and **File Mode**.
4. Evaluate queries followed by comments both in **REPL** and  **File Mode**.

## Major Update/Announcement:
I see this project as I think this project may have a bigger picture and better use-case, so for it to grow more feature-rich with advanced math support, the whole project will be 
re-written in latest version of **Python** (In Near Future IDK) to help this project grow. We are ready to sacrifice some performance for the sake of much more advanced features.
As you all know I have zero experience with python, so by this I will also master a bigger chunk of python and at the same time project will grow.

## Note:
Overall the concept will remain the same, but later this repo will be archived whenever the updates mentioned above are finally pushed.
The LICENSE file will be updated to allow other developers to fork, test and learn something from the code such as basic Lexing and Parsing.
Lastly, **MmQLC** will remain **MmQLC**, but the Python version will be called **MmQLPy (similarly, a new repo will be created !)**.
